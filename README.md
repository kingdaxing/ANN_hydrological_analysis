Rainfall-Runoff Analysis by Artificial Neural Network Models
This personal exercise involves 3 ANNs methods to build rainfall-runoff models for flooding prediction. 
1) using R package 'neuralnet' to build a simple model involving 2 hidden layers with 4~6 units in the 1st layer and 2~3 units in 2nd; 
2) a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was trained in R;
3) an ANN Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is trained in Python.
