Rainfall-Runoff Analysis using Artificial Neural Network Models </br>
This personal exercise involves 3 ANNs to build rainfall-runoff models for flooding prediction. Generally, LSTM represents better performance for time series forecast compared to MLP.
1) using R package 'neuralnet' to build a simple model involving 2 hidden layers with 4 units in the 1st layer and 3 units in 2nd; 
2) a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was trained in R;
3) an ANN Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is trained in Python.
